Welcome to the resources page for the JNUC 2025 `session 1069` - **Blueprints: Level Up Your Jamf School Deployment**

The resources below are related to many of the points and topics covered during the session. Some to support the native, some with additional background and others that dive deeper into some the things I glossed over in the talk. 

All worth looking at, when you have the time, to deepen your knowledge on the topic off DDM and blueprints so you can not just level up your Jamf School Deployment but rocket through to the next stages of mobile device management

### WWDC: Apple On DDM
As pointed out during the session Apple started to lay the ground work for DDM a few years back. Below are the stand out sessions (or sections of sessions) that if you watch from earliest to latest will show how Apple is very much committed to Declarative Device Management

- [WWDC 2021 - Meet declarative device management](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10131/)
- [WWDC 2022 - Adopt declarative device management](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10046/)
- [WWDC 2023 - Explore advances in declarative device management](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10041/)
- [WWDC 2024 - What’s new in device management](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10143/) Section: _07:15-11:45_
- [WWDC 2025 - What’s new in Apple device management and identity](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/258/?time=0) Section: _08:15-09:25_

### Apple Documentation
The Apple Platform Deployment documentations is great for anybody managing Apple devices but theres a section specifically around Software Updates and what this means for users when enforcing updates via DDM. Theres also a nice explaination of when the end user gets the _"You need to update your device by..."_ notifications

### Jamf on DDM for Jamf School
Theres a few blogs that I've written for the Jamf Blog which talks about DDM and then blueprints in the context of Jamf School. We didn't cover the Status channel too much in the session but the first blog does dig a little deeper into how and why. The second blog follows on from JNUC 2024 when blueprints were first released and goes over a software updates flow, included some recommended smart group set ups

### Jamf Account
During the session we took a look at how Jamf has modernised infrastructure and discussed how the platform approach will help to deliver continues and rapid feature delivery. As part of that section we mentioned Jamf Account and how this is a single login for Jamf services and the key to platform and blueprints. If Jamf Account is new to you then please check out both the Jamf Account Documentation, the Jamf Blog and the LinkedIn post by Matt Vlasach, VP Product at Jamf who puts a real nice and clear bow on Jamf Account

### Jamf Nation Live
Towards the end of the session we took a looked at a situation where we had managed **Service Configurations** via DDM with blueprints. This was from a user perspective and I always knew I'd be cutting it fine in regards to time so we didn't look at the configuration to manage this, or should I say, we didn't look at this from the Admin side. Below is a link to a video for a session on blueprints from Jamf Nation Live. Myself and a colleague give a admin look into managing service configurations. The examples are all in Jamf Pro but as we learnt in the session, since blueprints is a platform service, its the same process in Jamf School.

If you are a Jamf School admin in some way shape or form then you'll know that there is very little in the macAdmin world that is dedicated to only Education, never mind specifically Jamf School!
